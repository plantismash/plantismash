AT2G33860	AT2G33860.1	ettin (ett) mutations have pleiotropic effects on Arabidopsis flower development; causing increases in perianth organ number; decreases in stamen number and anther formation; and apical-basal patterning defects in the gynoecium. The ETTIN gene encodes a protein with homology to DNA binding proteins which bind to auxin response elements. ETT transcript is expressed throughout stage 1 floral meristems and subsequently resolves to a complex pattern within petal; stamen and carpel primordia.  ETT probably functions to impart regional identity in floral meristems that affects perianth organ number spacing; stamen formation; and regional differentiation in stamens and the gynoecium. During stage 5; ETT expression appears in a ring at the top  of the floral meristem before morphological appearance of the gynoecium; consistent with the proposal that ETT is involved in prepatterning apical and basal boundaries in the gynoecium primordium.  It is a target of the ta-siRNA tasiR-ARF. ETT is also a target of AP2; integrateing the functions of AGAMOUS and APETALA2 in floral meristem determinacy.

AT2G47460	AT2G47460.1	"MYB12 belongs to subgroup 7 of the R2R3-MYB family.

The activation requires a functional MYB recognition element (MRE). Results from the myb12-1f allele indicate that an activation domain might be present in the C-terminus. Overexpression or knock-out plants do not show any obvious phenotype under greenhouse conditions. Young myb12-ko seedlings contain reduced amounts of flavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol); while seedlings as well as leaves of MYB12-OX plants displayed an increased flavonoid content. They did not show any significant difference in anthocyanin content. Expression of CHS and FLS shows a clear correlation to MYB12 expression levels. CHI and F3H show increased transcript levels in the MYB12-OX lines; but no differences in the knock-out. Even in the absence of functional MYB12; flavonol biosynthesis is not completely absent; suggesting functional redundancy.

Up-regulated in response to heat; a bZIP28 null mutant has a heat-sensitive phenotype.  bZIP28 has a similar domain structure to the mammalian ATF6 protein involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR); and shares a bZIP domain; transmembrane domain; and a canonical S1P cleavage site. The bZIP28 seems to be glycosylated in vivo. bZIP28 does not appear to be transcriptionally up-regulated by UPR-inducing tunicamycin (TM) treatment. But; the expression level of three UPR-related genes is reduced in TM-treated zip28 mutants relative to wild type seedlings. And several UPR genes are transcriptionally upregulated when an N-terminal portion of the bZIP28 protein is expressed using the 35S promoter. A myc:bZIP28 fusion protein appears to be cleaved; likely at a canonical S2 cleavage site; following a TM treatment or a DTT stress-inducing treatment; but not a salt treatment. A portion of the  mGFP:bZIP28 protein present in root cells appears to translocate from the cytoplasm and ER to the nucleus following TM treatment.

AT5G03150	AT5G03150.1	JKD is a nuclear-localized putative transcription factor of the BIRDS/IDD C2H2 zinc finger family. JKD and its homologue BIB; restrict SHR movement to a single layer; the endodermis; and delimit tissue boundaries in the root meristem through a process that involves nuclear retention through protein complex formation. JKD mutation leads to periclinal divisions in the cortex; increased cell numbers in the circumference of the cortical and epidermal layers; a disrupted QC marker expression pattern; and disorganized QC and columella cells. This effect is enhanced in jkd bib double mutants where tissue boundaries cannot be maintained due to excessive SHR movement. JKD and BIB restrict CYCIND6 expression to cortex and endodermis stem cells to prevent formative divisions in the ground tissue.  JKD physically interacts with cell fate determinants SCR and SHR in a cell type specific manner. Native FRET-FLIM analysis showed higher JKD-SCR complex in the endodermis and predominant JKD-SHR in the QC and cortex/endodermis stem cells. In addition; JKD; SCR and SHR form a ternary complex whose conformation is cell type dependent; conformational changes of this complex differentially regulate SCR and WOX5 expression to specify endodermal cell fate and QC function respectively.

AtHB53 is auxin-inducible and its induction is inhibited by cytokinin; especially in roots therefore may be involved in root development.	protein_coding	HOMEOBOX 53 (HB53)	HOMEOBOX 53 (HB53);ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA HOMEOBOX 53 (ATHB53);HOMEOBOX-8 (HB-8)

AT5G65310	AT5G65310.1	Encodes a class I HDZip (homeodomain-leucine zipper) protein that is a positive regulator of ABA-responsiveness; mediating the inhibitory effect of ABA on growth during seedling establishment.	protein_coding	HOMEOBOX PROTEIN 5 (HB5)	HOMEOBOX PROTEIN 5 (ATHB5);HOMEOBOX PROTEIN 5 (HB5); (ATHB-5)	
AT5G64750	AT5G64750.1	Encodes a putative transcription factor containing an AP2 domain. Is a member of the ERF (ethylene response factor) subfamily B-4 of ERF/AP2 transcription factor family.  Expressed in response to ABA; osmotic stress; sugar stress and drought. Mutants are hypersensitive to these stresses. May be involved in regulation of ABA mediated stress response. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	protein_coding	ABA REPRESSOR1 (ABR1)	 (ERF111);ABA REPRESSOR1 (ABR1)
