PlantiSMASH - Plant Secondary Metabolites Analysis Shell
===================================================================

Development & Funding
---------------------

The development of antiSMASH was started as a collaboration of the Department of
Microbial Physiology and Groningen Bioinformatics Centre of the University of
Groningen, the Department of Microbiology of the University of TÃ¼bingen, the Manchester
Institute of Biotechnology, and the Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic
Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco.
With the move of the PIs and developers, development continues now at the Bioinformatics
Group at Wageningen University and The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for
Biosustainability in Lyngby.

antiSMASH development was/is supported by the GenBiotics program of the Dutch
Technology Foundation (STW), which is the applied-science division of The
Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and the Technology
Programme of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (grant STW 10463), GenBioCom
program of the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) grant 0315585A,
the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF) and the Novo Nordisk Foundation.
